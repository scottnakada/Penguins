    <h1>BASIC FACTS ABOUT PENGUINS</h1>

    <h4>
      <p>
        Penguins are aquatic, flightless birds that are highly adapted to life in the water. Their distinct
        tuxedo-like appearance is called countershading, a form of camouflage that helps keep them safe in
        the water. Penguins do have wing-bones, though they are flipper-like and extremely suited to swimming.
        Penguins are found almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, where they catch their food
        underwater and raise their young on land.
      </p>
    </h4>

    <h3>Diet</h3>
    <h4>
      <strong>Staples:</strong> Krill, fish and squid.
      <p>
        In general, penguins closer to the equator eat more fish and penguins closer to Antarctica eat
        more squid and krill.
      </p>
    </h4>

    <h3>Population</h3>

    <h4>
      <p>
        The penguin species with the highest population is the Macaroni penguin with 11,654,000 pairs.
        The species with the lowest population is the endangered Galapagos penguin with between 6,000-15,000
        individuals.
      </p>
    </h4>

    <h3>Range</h3>

    <h4>
      <p>
        Penguins can be found on every continent in the Southern Hemisphere from the tropical Galapagos
        Islands (the Galapagos penguin) located near South America to Antarctica (the emperor penguin).

    <h3>Behavoir</h3>

    <h4>
      <p>
        Penguins can spend up to 75% of their lives in the water. They do all of their hunting in the water.
        Their prey can be found within 60 feet of the surface, so penguins have no need to swim in deep water.
        They catch prey in their beaks and swallow them whole as they swim. Some species only leave the water
        for molting and breeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Penguins are social birds. Many species feed, swim and nest in groups. During the breeding season,
        some species form large groups, or &#x201C;rookeries&#x201D;, that include thousands of penguins. Each penguin has
        a distinct call, allowing individuals to find their mate and their chicks even in large groups.

    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
    <h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mating Season:</strong> Varies depending on the species, though most
          breed during spring and summer.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Incubation:</strong> Varies from 1 month-66 days depending on the species.</li>
        <li><strong>Number of offspring:</strong> King and emperor penguins lay one egg. All other
          species of penguin lay two eggs.
        </li>
